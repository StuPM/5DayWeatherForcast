## Features

When the website loads for the first time, a popup will appear asking for location permission to be allowed or blocked.

- If allowed, weather based on your location determined by the browser will appear.
- If denied, an error message will display explaining the available options to show you weather.

As well as the above, the search bar can be used to search for a location to display the weather for. For instance, if you live in London but want to know the weather in New York.

Lastly, a help box is shown in the bottom right that explains the options available when searching.

  - SASS to apply styling and also media queries to apply conditional styling based on the screen size.
