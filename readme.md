# WEATHER FORECAST PROJECT

## AIM

I have created a weather forecast website, that will show you the weather for the next 5 days at lunchtime/12 noon.

### BUILD PROCESS

Using the OpenWeatherAPI to provide 2 ways to get the forecast:

1. Using the GEO Location API built in with browsers.
2. Searching for a location via a search bar.

## To Do

- [ ] Obsequre the API key
- [ ] Display the location state (name and country displayed currently)
- [ ] Bring back multiple results from the search bar for location
